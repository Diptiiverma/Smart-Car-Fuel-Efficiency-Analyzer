🚗 Smart Car Fuel Efficiency Analyzer

📌 Project Description

The Smart Car Fuel Efficiency Analyzer is a NumPy-based data analysis project that evaluates vehicle fuel efficiency, identifies low-performing cars, and automatically generates service recommendations using vectorized numerical operations.

This project demonstrates how NumPy broadcasting, masking, slicing, and percentile analysis can be applied to real-world automotive datasets to make performance-based decisions.

🎯 Objectives

1. Analyze car mileage and performance
2. Detect inefficient vehicles
3. Identify best and worst performing cars
4. Generate service recommendation reports
5. Practice real-world NumPy data analysis techniques

⚙️ Technologies Used

Python 3.x
NumPy
CSV file handling

🧠 Analysis Performed

1. Average mileage calculation
2. Fuel efficiency scoring using broadcasting
3. Low efficiency car detection (25th percentile)
4. Best & worst car ranking
5. Outlier detection (90th percentile)
6. Automatic service recommendation generation
